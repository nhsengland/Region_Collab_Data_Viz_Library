# {PROJECT NAME}
## NHS England Regional R Data Viz Library

### About the Project

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

This repository holds code for data visualisation within R, using a collection of published datasets that are available at different organisational and geographic breakdowns. The intention of this project is to share code across all regions and encourage increased usage of R by having a library colleagues can access.

### Project Stucture

- The main output is a html file that utilises quarto to provide a documentent that users can interact with, much like a library
- The data visualisations are sorted by type within the html output, with associated code and a link to the public data that can be used to get you started
- The html is a output of the QMD file
