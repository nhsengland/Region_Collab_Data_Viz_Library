# NHSE R Data Viz Library
## NHS England Regional Collaboration

### About the Project

[![status: experimental](https://github.com/GIScience/badges/raw/master/status/experimental.svg)](https://github.com/GIScience/badges#experimental)

This repository holds code for data visualisation within R, using a collection of published datasets that are available at different organisational and geographic breakdowns. The intention of this project is to share code across all regions and encourage increased usage of R by having a library colleagues can access.

_**Note:** Only public data is shared in this repository._

### Project Stucture

- The main output is a html file that utilises rmarkdown to provide a documentent that users can interact with, much like a library: [https://github.com/nhsengland/Region_Collab_Data_Viz_Library/blob/main/Regional_R_Data_Viz_Library.rmd](https://github.com/nhsengland/Region_Collab_Data_Viz_Library/blob/main/Regional_R_Data_Viz_Library.Rmd)
- The data visualisations are sorted by type within the html output, with associated code and a sample dataset and list of packages to load to get you started: [https://github.com/nhsengland/Region_Collab_Data_Viz_Library/blob/main/Regional_R_Data_Viz_Library.html](https://github.com/nhsengland/Region_Collab_Data_Viz_Library/blob/main/Regional_R_Data_Viz_Library.html)

### Built With

R studio

#### Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

To clone the repo:

`git clone [https://github.com/nhsengland/Region_Collab_Data_Viz_Library]`

If you would like to contribute to the code library, create a branch off dev for review to commit back into the main branch.

More information on NHSRTheme package: https://nhs-r-community.github.io/NHSRtheme/

### Usage
This code can be utilised within R for creating your own data visualisations.

#### Outputs
The main output of this repo is a html document that serves as a library, with examples of data visualisations and associated code.

#### Datasets
This library utilises the NHSRdatasets package.

### Roadmap
