## RTT

For reporting on RTT pathways, there are 2 main sources for general & acute hospital pathways. The RTT monthly reporting can be useful for Trust and ICB level reporting as it is a historical return with many years data. However, the limitations are within the detail. Small volume treatment functions are grouped into ‘Medical Other’, ‘Surgical Other’ and Paediatric specialties are grouped. This data set is also aggregated at a Treatment Function level. For more detailed reporting, the Waiting List Minimum Data set is submitted weekly. It is at pathway level and therefore gives a lot more detail, however it was introduced as part of the COVID-19 pandemic and is only available from circa June 2021.

From February 2024, some community pathways were moved to the Community Services Data set to be reported. (TFCs impacted - 290: Community Paediatric Service and 504: Community Sexual and Reproductive Health Service)

## **Related guidance**

Monthly RTT guidance and published data: <https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/rtt-waiting-times/rtt-guidance/>

Note that the monthly submission is reported under 'parts' which can be found in the SQL tables.

-   \[RTT_Part_Name\] 'Part_1A' - Clock Stops for Admitted Pathways

-   \[RTT_Part_Name\] 'Part_1B' - Clock Stops for Non-Admitted Pathways

-   \[RTT_Part_Name\] 'Part_2' - Incomplete Pathways

-   \[RTT_Part_Name\] 'Part_2A' - Incomplete Pathways with DTA

-   \[RTT_Part_Name\]='Part_3' - Clock Starts

Also note the below re: reporting by specialty, if you keep 999 included, then you will be duplicating your total. If you want to report by specialty, there are some that align to Treatment Function Code, however smaller Treatment Functions are grouped under 'Other' as below. The breakdown of other into Medical, Mental Health, Paediatric, Surgical and Other was implemented in April 2021 ([DCB0095: Consultant-led referral to treatment (RTT) waiting times - NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0095-referral-to-treatment-rtt-waiting-times)).

## Monthly Referrals Return (MRR)

The Monthly Referral Return (MRR) contains data relating to GP and other referrals for first consultant-led outpatient appointments focusing on all treatment functions and specific acute treatment functions.MRR figures are submitted monthly from June 2020 by NHS trusts and independent sector providers treating NHS patients. Referrals information prior to June 2020 can be sourced from the Monthly Hospital Activity (MAR) with the exception of other referrals (all specialties) which can be sourced from the Quarterly Hospital Activity (QAR).

The main limitation for using this data set, is that it is submitted aggregated to Organisation, meaning that we are unable to breakdown by specialty as it isn't reported at this level.

## Specialist Advice (System EROC)

Monthly specialist advice activity returns are collected from Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) as part of the System Elective Recovery Outpatient Collection (System EROC).

The data are available by ‘type of specialist advice’. For the purposes of this data collection, the different types are categorised as:

-   Pre-referral - Advice & guidance

-   Post-referral - triage services that offer specialist advice

-   Other - equivalent models

The system EROC data is published (see related guidance) and can also be found on Model Health System and a System EROC Tableau Dashboard.

There are alot of caveats to be applied when reporting from this source:

-   When reporting at responding provider level, some Trusts may seem like they have a low utilsiation rate, however they may have commissioned another Provider to respond e.g. Consultant Connect. Therefore, Consultant Connect will be the responding provider.

-   The latest reporting month is usually a 'flex' month and will be frozen the following month. Expect low volumes that will be updated in the following month if looking at the most recent data.

The Monthly A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions collection collects the total number of attendances in the specified period for all A&E types, including Urgent Treatment Centres, Minor Injury Units and Walk-in Centres, and of these, the number discharged, admitted or transferred within four hours of arrival.

Also included are the number of Emergency Admissions, and any waits of over four hours for admission following decision to admit.

Data are shown at provider organisation level, from NHS Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts and Independent Sector Organisations.

Regular NHS performance statistics publication are scheduled for the 2nd Thursday of each month and include A&E data from the previous month.

## A&E Daily SitRep

The daily situation report (sitrep) indicates where there are pressures on the NHS around the country in areas such as breaches of the four-hour waiting time, ambulance handover delays and general and acute bed capacity.

In terms of A&E reported, it includes A&E attendances and 4 hour breaches by A&E department type. For type 1 attendances, there is a breakdown by acuity (i.e. resus, majors, minors and paediatrics). Booked attendances are also reported, along with A&E trolley waits and patients streamed to a co-located primary care led streaming service, time to treatment for type 1 within 60 minutes, A&E closures and admissions from A&E.

The Admitted Patient Care CDS contains data for a finished general admitted care episode and spell. This data set covers all NHS and private activity that is daycase or inpatient, taking place in any acute, community, mental health Trust or non-NHS hospital where care is delivered as NHS-funded. The activity is submitted at either episode or spell level, dependent on which level of reporting is required.

## Discharge Delays (Acute)

Daily returns are collected from acute trusts through the COVID-19 acute daily discharge situation report (SitRep) and include data on daily discharges from acute settings.

Note that daily data are collected on discharges from acute hospitals, and a weekly snapshot is collected for information on patients who have remained in hospital since no longer meeting the criteria to reside decision was made.

Common measures:

-   Patients who no longer meet the criteria to reside, Discharged or Not discharged by the end of the day.

-   Discharge destinations

-   Delay reasons for patients with 14+ days length of stay

-   Number of additional days in total patients have remained in hospital since no longer meeting the criteria to reside decision was made (7+ days, 14+ days, and 21+ days length of stay)

Data caveats: This SitRep collects data for all inpatients 18 and over including critical care and COVID-19 positive patients but excluding paediatrics, maternity, and deceased patients. This includes data for acute trusts with a type 1 A&E department. Mental Health Trusts, specialised Trusts (including Children’s and Women’s Trusts) are not in scope of this collection.

The monthly diagnostics waiting times and activity return collects data on waiting times and activity for 15 key diagnostic tests and procedures. It contains aggregate level data submitted by providers, broken down by commissioner.

It contains aggregate level data submitted by providers, broken down by commissioner. The data measures the current waiting times of patients still waiting for 15 key diagnostic tests or procedures at the month end. This data is split by number of weeks waiting, and by test. Diagnostics test activity across the month is also collected broken down by waiting list, planned and unscheduled.

Data for this collection is available back to January 2006. The monthly diagnostics collection is used to measure performance against the diagnostic operational standard (less than 1% of patients should wait 6 weeks or more for a diagnostic test).

## Diagnostic Imaging Dataset

The Diagnostic Imaging Dataset (DID) is a central collection of detailed information about diagnostic imaging tests carried out on NHS patients, extracted from local Radiology Information Systems (RISs) and submitted monthly.

The DID captures information about referral source and patient type, details of the test (type of test and body site), demographic information such as GP registered practice, patient postcode, ethnicity, gender and date of birth, plus items about waiting times for each diagnostic imaging event, from time of test request through to time of reporting. The data is collected at patient level.

# Section 6 - Cancer

::: panel-tabset
## National Cancer Waiting Times Data Set (CWT)

The national Cancer Waiting Times (CWT) system allows NHS providers to record data derived from patient care activity. This data can be used to monitor cancer waiting times targets or plan service improvements. As a patient moves through the stages of their treatment pathway data on referrals, treatments and diagnosis are derived from care records locally (decisions on how to collect these data from local systems are made locally).

The data is published to show waiting times of people referred with suspected cancer or breast symptoms and subsequently told the outcome of their diagnosis, and treated for cancer by the NHS in England.
